Development of the desktop version is suspended because the focus is on the mobile version.

Last status of the development is:
* idea was to replace bootstrap glyphicon with text => let's see what is done with mobile version
* treemap widget is not quite usable => let's see what can be designed with mobile version

Feature originally foreseen:
* display of images (to be able to play a "real" gamebook with a mix-in of text and images)
    => let's see that point later (text is not supported on minimal mobile version)
* replace css of bootstrap with http://getskeleton.com/
    => abandoned if google material layout of mobile version is nice enough for desktop as well
* re-import game (same to be a bug)
    => let's see what is done with mobile version
* import lone wolf games as they are freely available on the net
    => could require quite complex work to integrate well the rules of this game
    => require maybe greater storage as localstorage (see localforage)
* language in url
* better oop class for data/model
* support better aria
    => more as technical purpose as gamebooks won't likely be in braille
* tooltip with touch screen, mobile
    => see what's is implemented with mobile version
