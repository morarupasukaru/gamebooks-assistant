<div class="frontmatter">

 <p>You are Lone Wolf. In a devastating attack the Darklords have 
destroyed the monastery where you were learning the skills of the Kai 
Lords. You are the sole survivor.</p>

 <p>In <strong><cite>Flight from the Dark</cite></strong>, you swear 
revenge. But first you must reach Holmgard to warn the King of the 
gathering evil. Relentlessly the servants of darkness hunt you across 
your country and every turn of the page presents a new challenge. Choose
 your skills and your weapons carefully—for they can help you succeed in
 the most fantastic and terrifying journey of your life.</p>

 
      <p><strong>Joe Dever</strong>, the creator of the bestselling Lone
 Wolf adventure books and novels, has achieved world-wide recognition in
 three creative fields—as an award-winning author of international 
renown, as an acclaimed musician and composer, and as a games designer 
specialising in role-playing games.</p>

   <p>On graduating from college in 1974, Joe Dever became a 
professional musician, and for several years, he worked in the music 
industry in Europe and the United States.</p>

   <p>While working in Los Angeles in 1977 he discovered a then 
little-known game called ‘Dungeons &amp; Dragons’. Although the game was
 in its infancy, Joe at once realised its huge potential and began 
designing his own role-playing games along similar conceptual lines. 
These first games were to form the basis of a fantasy world called 
Magnamund, which later became the setting for the Lone Wolf books.</p>

   <p>Five years later, in 1982 at the Origins Game Fair, Joe won the 
Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons World Championships in Baltimore, an 
event held before 16,000 people. Inspired and encouraged by his success 
at Origins, Joe decided to quit the music business and devote his time 
to writing and games design.</p>

   <p>In 1983, after a brief spell at Games Workshop in London, he wrote <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>—the
 first Lone Wolf interactive gamebook. His manuscript immediately 
attracted a frenzy of interest from three major London publishing 
companies, all of whom bid for world rights. Joe accepted an offer of 
publication from Hutchinson’s (later to become Century Hutchinson Ltd; 
now Random House UK) and <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite> was first published in 1984.</p>

   <p>This first book sold more than 100,000 copies within its first 
month of publication, and overseas rights were snapped up by twelve 
countries (including the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, 
and Sweden). The success of Joe’s first book laid the foundations for 
the future of the Lone Wolf series, which has sold millions of copies 
around the world.</p>

   <p>The Lone Wolf series ended after 28 books and 14 years. Joe has 
continued to work in the games industry as script writer and games 
design consultant.</p>


     <p><strong>Gary Chalk</strong>, the illustrator of the early Lone 
Wolf series, was born in 1952, grew up in Hertfordshire, England. Being 
interested in history, he began playing war games at the age of fifteen.
 When he graduated from college with a Bachelor of Arts in design, Gary 
spent three years training in a studio before becoming a teacher in art 
and design.</p>

  <p>Gary was working as a children’s book illustrator when he became 
involved in adventure gaming, an interest which eventually led to the 
creation of several successful games. He is the inventor/illustrator of 
some of Britain’s biggest-selling fantasy games including Cry Havoc, 
Starship Captain, and Battlecars (co-designed with Ian Livingstone). He 
is also known for his work on the very successful game, Talisman.</p>

  <p>Gary was working at Games Workshop when Joe Dever asked him to illustrate some of his manuscript of <cite>Flight from the Dark</cite>. The two teamed up after that and they continued to work together until the eighth book in the series, <cite>The Jungle of Horrors</cite>.</p>

  <p>Gary has also drawn the illustrations in <cite>Redwall</cite> and related books, <cite>The Prince of Shadows</cite>
 gamebook series, and several books which he also authored. Gary 
continues to enjoy war gaming and works as an illustrator and model 
maker.</p>

<h2><a name="tssf">The Story So Far…</a></h2>

<p>In the northern land of Sommerlund, it has been the custom for many 
centuries to send the children of the Warrior Lords to the monastery of 
Kai. There they are taught the skills and disciplines of their noble 
fathers.</p>
<p>The Kai monks are masters of their art, and the children in their 
charge love and respect them in spite of the hardships of their 
training. For one day when they have finally learnt the secret skills of
 the Kai, they will return to their homes equipped in mind and body to 
defend themselves against the constant threat of war from the Darklords 
of the west.</p>
<p>In olden times, during the Age of the Black Moon, the Darklords waged
 war on Sommerlund. The conflict was a long and bitter trial of strength
 that ended in victory for the Sommlending at the great battle of 
Maakengorge. King Ulnar and the allies of Durenor broke the Darklord 
armies at the pass of Moytura and forced them back into the bottomless 
abyss of Maakengorge. Vashna, mightiest of the Darklords, was slain upon
 the sword of King Ulnar, called ‘Sommerswerd’, the sword of the sun. 
Since that age, the Darklords have vowed vengeance upon Sommerlund and 
the House of Ulnar.</p>
<p>Now it is in the morning of the feast of Fehmarn, when all of the Kai
 Lords are present at the monastery for the celebrations. Suddenly a 
great black cloud comes from out of the western skies. So many are the 
numbers of the black-winged beasts that fill the sky, that the sun is 
completely hidden. The Darklords, ancient enemy of the Sommlending are 
attacking. War has begun.</p>
<p>On this fateful morning, you, Silent Wolf (the name given to you by 
the Kai) have been sent to collect firewood in the forest as a 
punishment for your inattention in class. As you are preparing to 
return, you see to your horror a vast cloud of black leathery creatures 
swoop down and engulf the monastery.</p>
<p>Dropping the wood, you race to the battle that has already begun. But
 in the unnatural dark, you stumble and strike your head on a low tree 
branch. As you lose consciousness, the last thing that you see in the 
poor light are the walls of the monastery crashing to the ground.</p>
<p>Many hours pass before you awake. With tears in your eyes you now 
survey the scene of destruction. Raising your face to the clear sky, you
 swear vengeance on the Darklords for the massacre of the Kai warriors, 
and with a sudden flash of realization you know what you must do. You 
must set off on a perilous journey to the capital city to warn the King 
of the terrible threat that now faces his people. For you are now the 
last of the Kai—you are now the Lone Wolf.</p>
</div><div class="frontmatter">
<h2><a name="gamerulz">The Game Rules</a></h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and physical stamina—<small>ENDURANCE</small>.
 Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective 
your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes 
closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 14). When you fight, your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <small>ENDURANCE</small>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <small>ENDURANCE</small> section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points. If at any time your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
<h3><a name="discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a></h3>

<p>Over the centuries, the Kai monks have mastered the skills of the 
warrior. These skills are known as the Kai Disciplines, and they are 
taught to all Kai Lords. You have learnt only five of the skills listed 
below. The choice of which five skills these are, is for you to make. As
 all of the Disciplines may be of use to you at some point on your 
perilous quest, pick your five with care. The correct use of a 
Discipline at the right time can save your life.</p>
<p>When you have chosen your five Disciplines, enter them in the Kai Disciplines section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="camflage">Camouflage</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline enables a Kai Lord to blend in with his surroundings.
 In the countryside, he can hide undetected among trees and rocks and 
pass close to an enemy without being seen. In a town or city, it enables
 him to look and sound like a native of that area, and can help him to 
find shelter or a safe hiding place.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Camouflage’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="hunting">Hunting</a></h4>

<p>This skill ensures that a Kai Lord will never starve in the wild. He 
will always be able to hunt for food for himself except in areas of 
wasteland and desert. The skill also enables a Kai Lord to be able to 
move stealthily when stalking his prey.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Hunting: no need for a Meal when instructed to eat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="sixthsns">Sixth Sense</a></h4>

<p>This skill may warn a Kai Lord of imminent danger. It may also reveal
 the true purpose of a stranger or strange object encountered in your 
adventure.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Sixth Sense’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="tracking">Tracking</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to make the correct choice of a path in
 the wild, to discover the location of a person or object in a town or 
city and to read the secrets of footprints or tracks.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Tracking’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="healing">Healing</a></h4>

<p>This Discipline can be used to restore <small>ENDURANCE</small> points lost in combat. If you possess this skill you may restore 1 <small>ENDURANCE</small>
 point to your total for every numbered section of the book you pass 
through in which you are not involved in combat. (This is only to be 
used after your <small>ENDURANCE</small> has fallen below its original level.) Remember that your <small>ENDURANCE</small> cannot rise above its original level.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill write ‘Healing: +1 <small>ENDURANCE</small> point for each section without combat’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="wepnskll">Weaponskill</a></h4>

<p>Upon entering the Kai Monastery, each initiate is taught to master 
one type of weapon. If Weaponskill is to be one of your Kai Disciplines,
 pick a number in the usual way from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>,
 and then find the corresponding weapon from the list below. This is the
 weapon in which you have skill. When you enter combat carrying this 
weapon, you add 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>.</p>
<p>The fact that you are skilled with a weapon does not mean you set out
 on the adventure carrying that particular weapon. However, you will 
have opportunities to acquire weapons in the course of your adventures. 
If you pick the axe, you are lucky enough to be skilled in the one 
weapon Lone Wolf is carrying from the start of the adventure. (This will
 be explained fully in the <a href="#equipmnt">Equipment section</a>.)</p>
<ul class="unbulleted">
<li>0 = Dagger</li>
<li>1 = Spear</li>
<li>2 = Mace</li>
<li>3 = Short Sword</li>
<li>4 = Warhammer</li>
<li>5 = Sword</li>
<li>6 = Axe</li>
<li>7 = Sword</li>
<li>8 = Quarterstaff</li>
<li>9 = Broadsword</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot carry more than 2 weapons. If you choose this skill, write ‘Weaponskill in _______ +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points if this weapon carried’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindshld">Mindshield</a></h4>

<p>The Darklords and many of the evil creatures in their command have 
the ability to attack you using their Mindforce. The Kai Discipline of 
Mindshield prevents you from losing any <small>ENDURANCE</small> points when subjected to this form of attack.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindshield: no points lost when attacked by Mindblast’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mndblst">Mindblast</a></h4>

<p>This enables a Kai Lord to attack an enemy using the force of his 
mind. It can be used at the same time as normal combat weapons and adds 
two extra points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. Not all the creatures encountered on this adventure will be harmed by Mindblast. You will be told if a creature is immune.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mindblast: +2 <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> points’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="anmlknsp">Animal Kinship</a></h4>

<p>This skill enables a Kai Lord to communicate with some animals and to be able to guess the intentions of others.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Animal Kinship’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="mindomtr">Mind Over Matter</a></h4>

<p>Mastery of this Discipline enables a Kai Lord to move small objects with his powers of concentration.</p>
<p>If you choose this skill, write ‘Mind Over Matter’ on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>If you successfully complete the mission as set in Book 1 of <cite>Lone Wolf</cite>, you may add a further Kai Discipline of your choice to your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> in <a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-simple/lw/02fotw.htm#title">Book 2</a>.
 This additional skill, together with your five other skills and any 
Special Items that you have picked up in Book 1, may then be used in the
 next adventure of the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series which is called <cite><a href="https://www.projectaon.org/en/xhtml-simple/lw/02fotw.htm#title">Fire on the Water</a></cite>.</p>
<h3><a name="equipmnt">Equipment</a></h3>

<p>You are dressed in the green tunic and cloak of a Kai initiate. You have little with you to arm yourself for survival.</p>
<p>All you possess is an Axe (note under Weapons on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) and a Backpack containing 1 Meal (note under Meals on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>). Hanging from your waist is a leather pouch containing Gold Crowns. To find out how many, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.
 This number equals the number of Gold Crowns you possess at the start 
of the adventure. (Note the number in the Belt Pouch section of the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>You discover amongst the smoking ruins of the monastery, a <a href="#map">Map of Sommerlund</a> (note under Special Items on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>) showing the capital city of Holmgard and the land of Durenor, far to the east. You place the <a href="#map">Map</a> inside your tunic for safety.</p>
<p>You also find one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 = Sword (Weapons)<br><br>
</li>
<li>2 = Helmet (Special Items). This adds 2 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>3 = Two Meals (Meals)<br><br>
</li>
<li>4 = Chainmail Waistcoat (Special Items). This adds 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>5 = Mace (Weapons)<br><br>
</li>
<li>6 = Healing Potion (Backpack Item). This can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total, when swallowed after combat. You only have enough for one dose.<br><br>
</li>
<li>7 = Quarterstaff (Weapons)<br><br>
</li>
<li>8 = Spear (Weapons)<br><br>
</li>
<li>9 = 12 Gold Crowns (Belt Pouch)<br><br>
</li>
<li>0 = Broadsword (Weapons)<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To discover which of the above you find, you must pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> and find the corresponding article on the list. Note this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, under the heading given in brackets, and make a note of any effect it may have on your <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</p>
<h4><a name="howcarry">How to Carry Equipment</a></h4>

<p>Now that you have your equipment, the following list shows you how it
 is carried. You don’t need to make notes but you can refer back to this
 list in the course of your adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 = Sword—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>2 = Helmet—worn on the head.</li>
<li>3 = Food—placed in the Backpack.</li>
<li>4 = Chainmail Waistcoat—worn on the body.</li>
<li>5 = Mace—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>6 = Healing Potion—carried in the Backpack.</li>
<li>7 = Quarterstaff—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>8 = Spear—carried in the hand.</li>
<li>9 = Gold Crowns—carried in the Belt Pouch.</li>
<li>0 = Broadsword—carried in the hand.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="howmuch">How Much Can You Carry?</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>The maximum number of weapons that you may carry is <em>two</em>.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>These must be stored in your Backpack. Because space is limited, you
 may only keep a maximum of eight articles, including Meals, in your 
Backpack at any one time.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Special Items are not carried in the Backpack. When you discover a Special Item, you will be told how to carry it.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>These are always carried in the Belt Pouch. It will hold a maximum of fifty crowns.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>Food is carried in your Backpack. Each Meal counts as one item.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Any item that may be of use and can be picked up on your adventure and entered on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> is given capital letters in the text. Unless you are told it is a Special Item, carry it in your Backpack.</p>
<h4><a name="howuse">How to Use Your Equipment</a></h4>

<dl>
<dt>Weapons</dt>
<dd>Weapons aid you in combat. If you have the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill and the correct weapon, it adds 2 points to your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>. If you enter a combat with no weapons, deduct 4 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>
 and fight with your bare hands. If you find a weapon during the 
adventure, you may pick it up and use it. (Remember you can only carry 
two Weapons at once.) You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.</dd>
<dt>Backpack Items</dt>
<dd>During your travels you will discover various useful items which you
 may wish to keep. (Remember you can only carry eight items in your 
Backpack at once.) You may exchange or discard them at any point when 
you are not involved in combat.</dd>
<dt>Special Items</dt>
<dd>Each Special Item has a particular purpose or effect. You may be 
told this when the item is discovered, or it may be revealed to you as 
the adventure progresses.</dd>
<dt>Gold Crowns</dt>
<dd>The local currency is the Crown, which is a small gold coin. Gold 
Crowns can be used on your adventure to pay for transport, food, or even
 as a bribe! Many of the creatures that you will encounter possess Gold 
Crowns, or have them hidden in their lairs. Whenever you kill a 
creature, you may take any Gold Crowns that it has and put them in your 
Belt Pouch.</dd>
<dt>Food</dt>
<dd>You will need to eat regularly during your adventure. If you do not 
have any food when you are instructed to eat a Meal, you will lose 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small>
 points. If you have chosen the Kai Discipline of Hunting as one of your
 five skills, you will not need to tick off a Meal when instructed to 
eat.</dd>
<dt>Healing Potion</dt>
<dd>This can restore 4 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to your total 
when swallowed after combat. There is only enough for one dose. If you 
discover any other potions during the adventure, you will be told then 
of their effect. All Healing Potions are Backpack Items.</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a></h3>

<p>There will be occasions on your adventure when you have to fight an enemy. The enemy’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and <small>ENDURANCE</small> points are given in the text. Lone Wolf’s aim in the combat is to kill the enemy by reducing his <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to zero while losing as few <small>ENDURANCE</small> points as possible himself.</p>
<p>At the start of a combat, enter Lone Wolf’s and the enemy’s <small>ENDURANCE</small> points in the appropriate boxes on the Combat Record section of your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>The sequence for combat is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add any extra points gained through your Kai Disciplines to your current <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> total.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. The result is your Combat Ratio. Enter it on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.<br><br>
Example<br><br>
Lone Wolf (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small> 15) is ambushed by a Winged Devil (<small>COMBAT SKILL</small>
 20). He is not given the opportunity to evade combat, but must stand 
and fight as the creature swoops down on him. Lone Wolf has the Kai 
Discipline of Mindblast, so he adds 2 points to his <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>, giving a total <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of 17.<br><br>
He subtracts the Winged Devil’s <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> from his own, giving a Combat Ratio of −3 (17 − 20 = −3). −3 is noted on the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as the Combat Ratio.<br><br>
</li>
<li><a name="stage3">When you have your Combat Ratio</a>, pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>. Along the 
top of the chart are shown the Combat Ratio numbers. Find the number 
that is the same as your Combat Ratio and cross-reference it with the 
random number that you have picked (the random numbers appear on the 
side of the chart). You now have the number of <small>ENDURANCE</small> 
points lost by both Lone Wolf and his enemy in this round of combat. (E 
represents points lost by the enemy; LW represents points lost by Lone 
Wolf.)<br><br>
Example<br><br>
The Combat Ratio between Lone Wolf and Winged Devil has been established as -3. If the number taken from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a> is a 6, then the result of the first round of combat is:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Lone Wolf loses 3 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
<li>Winged Devil loses 6 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points</li>
</ul><br><br>
</li>
<li>On the <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>, mark the changes in <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to the participants in the combat.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed, or unless you have an option to evade, the next round of combat now starts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Repeat the sequence from <a href="#stage3">Stage 3</a>.<br><br>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process of combat continues until the <small>ENDURANCE</small> 
points of either the enemy or Lone Wolf are reduced to zero or below, at
 which point that combatant is declared dead. If Lone Wolf is dead, the 
adventure is over. If the enemy is dead, Lone Wolf proceeds but with his
 <small>ENDURANCE</small> points possibly reduced.</p>
<p>A <a href="#crsumary">summary of Combat Rules</a> appears in the back of this book.</p>
<h4><a name="evasion">Evasion of Combat</a></h4>

<p>During your adventure you may be given the chance to evade combat. If
 you have already engaged in a round of combat and decide to evade, 
calculate the combat for that round in the usual manner. All points lost
 by the enemy as a result of that round are ignored, and you make your 
escape. Only Lone Wolf may lose <small>ENDURANCE</small> points during 
that round, but then that is the risk of running away! You may only 
evade if the text of the particular section allows you to do so.</p>
<h3><a name="levels">Levels of Kai Training</a></h3>

<p>The following table is a guide to the ranks and titles that are 
bestowed upon Kai Lords at each stage of their training. As you 
successfully complete each adventure in the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> series, you will gain an additional Kai Discipline and gradually progress towards mastery of the ten basic Kai Disciplines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Novice</li>
<li>Intuite</li>
<li>Doan</li>
<li>Acolyte</li>
<li>Initiate—You begin the <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures with this level of Kai training</li>
<li>Aspirant</li>
<li>Guardian</li>
<li>Warmarn or Journeyman</li>
<li>Savant</li>
<li>Master</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond the ten basic skills of the Kai Master await the secrets of 
the higher Kai Disciplines or ‘Magnakai’. By acquiring the wisdom of the
 Magnakai, a Kai Lord can progress towards the ultimate achievement and 
become a Kai Grand Master.</p>

<h2><a name="kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a></h2>

<p>Your mission will be one of great danger, for the Darklords and their
 servants are a cruel and fierce enemy who give and expect no mercy. Use
 the <a href="#map">map</a> to help you steer a correct course for the 
capital. Make notes as you progress through the story, for they will be

<p>Many things that you find will aid you during the adventure. Some Special Items will be of use in future <cite>Lone Wolf</cite> adventures and others may be red herrings of no real use at all, so be selective in what you decide to keep.</p>
<p>There are many routes to the King, but only one involves a minimum of

<h2><a name="numbered">Numbered Sections</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sect1">1</a></h3>

<p>You must make haste for you sense it is not safe to linger by the 
smoking remains of the ruined monastery. The black-winged beasts could 
return at any moment. You must set out for the Sommlending capital of 
Holmgard and tell the King the terrible news of the massacre: that the 
whole élite of Kai warriors, save yourself, have been slaughtered. 
Without the Kai Lords to lead her armies, Sommerlund will be at the 
mercy of their ancient enemy, the Darklords.</p>
<p>Fighting back tears, you bid farewell to your dead kinsmen. Silently,
 you promise that their deaths will be avenged. You turn away from the 
ruins and carefully descend the steep track.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill, the path splits into two directions, both leading into a large wood.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to use your Kai Discipline of Sixth Sense, <a href="#sect141">turn to 141</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to take the right path into the wood, <a href="#sect85">turn to 85</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow the left track, <a href="#sect275">turn to 275</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect2">2</a></h3>

<p>As you dash through the thickening trees, the shouts of the Giaks 
begin to fade behind you. You have nearly outdistanced them completely, 
when you crash headlong into a tangle of low branches.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have picked a number 0–4, <a href="#sect343">turn to 343</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have picked a number 5–9, <a href="#sect276">turn to 276</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect3">3</a></h3>

<p>Staying close to the officer, you follow him through an arched portal
 and up a short flight of stairs to a long hall. Soldiers run back and 
forth bearing orders on ornate scrolls to officers stationed around the 
city wall.</p>
<p>A haggard and scar-faced man dressed in the white and purple robes of
 the King’s court approaches you and bids you follow him to the citadel.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to follow this man, <a href="#sect196">turn to 196</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to decline his offer and return to the crowded streets, <a href="#sect144">turn to 144</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect4">4</a></h3>

<p>It is a small one-man canoe in very poor condition. The wood has 
split and warped, and the craft appears to be leaking in several places.
 You quickly patch up the worst of the holes with some clay and bail out
 the water. This seems to stop the leaking for the moment. Stowing your 
equipment at the bow, you set off downstream, using a piece of driftwood
 as a paddle.</p>
<p>After a short while, you hear the sound of horses galloping towards you along the left bank.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to use the Kai Discipline of Sixth Sense, <a href="#sect218">turn to 218</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to hide in the bottom of the canoe, <a href="#sect75">turn to 75</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to try to attract their attention, <a href="#sect175">turn to 175</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect5">5</a></h3>

<p>After about an hour of walking, the track slowly bears round to the 
east. You reach a shallow ford where a fast-flowing brook runs on a 
steep rocky course towards the south. Just beyond the ford is a junction
 where the track meets a wider path running north to south. Realizing 
that the north path will take you away from the capital, you turn right 
at the junction and head south.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect111">Turn to 111</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect6">6</a></h3>

<p>In the distance you can hear the sound of horses galloping nearer. 
You crouch behind a tree and wait as the riders come closer. They are 
the cavalry of the King’s Guard wearing the white uniforms of His 
Majesty’s army.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to call them, <a href="#sect183">turn to 183</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to let them pass and then continue on your way through the forest, <a href="#sect200">turn to 200</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect7">7</a></h3>

<p>For what seems an eternity, the rush of the crowd carries you along 
like a leaf on a fast-flowing stream. You desperately fight to stay on 
your feet, but you feel weak and dizzy from your ordeal, and your legs 
are as heavy as lead. Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a long, narrow 
stone stairway that leads up to the roof of an inn.</p>
<p>Gathering the last reserves of your strength, you dive for the stairs
 and climb slowly up to the top. From here you can see the magnificent 
view of the rooftops and spires of Holmgard, with the high stone walls 
of the citadel gleaming in the sun.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration I]</div>
<p>The houses and buildings of the capital are built very close to each 
other, and it is possible to jump from one roof to the next. In fact 
many of the citizens of Holmgard used to use the ‘Roofways’ (as they are
 known) when the heavy autumn rains made the unpaved parts of the 
streets too muddy for walking. But after many accidents, a royal decree 
forbade their use.</p>
<p>After careful thought, you decide to use the ‘Roofways’, as they are 
your only chance of reaching the King. You have hopped, skipped, and 
jumped across several streets and you are only one street away from the 
citadel when you come to the end of a row of rooftops.</p>
<p>The jump to the next row is much further than anything you have tried
 before, and your stomach begins to feel as if it were full of 
butterflies. Determined to reach the citadel, you turn and take a long 
run-up to the jump. With blood pounding in your ears, you sprint to the 
edge of the roof and leap into space, your eyes fixed on the opposite 
rooftop.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have picked a number that is 0–2, <a href="#sect108">turn to 108</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect8">8</a></h3>

<p>Your Kai Sixth Sense warns there is a fierce battle raging in the 
south. Your common sense tells you that the south is also the quickest 
route to the capital.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect70">Turn to 70</a> and choose your route.</p>

<h3><a name="sect9">9</a></h3>

<p>You cannot move: you are being held rigid by some powerful force. 
Your eyes are drawn towards the mouth of the skeleton. From deep in the 
earth you hear a low humming, like the sound of millions of angry bees. A
 dull red glow appears in the empty eye sockets of the dead King and the
 humming increases until your ears are filled with the deafening roar. 
You are in the presence of an ancient evil, far older and stronger than 
the Darklords themselves.</p>
<p class="choice">If you possess a Vordak Gem, <a href="#sect236">turn to 236</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not, <a href="#sect292">turn to 292</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect10">10</a></h3>

<p>You are sweating and your legs ache. In the middle distance you can see a group of cottages.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to enter a cottage and rest for a while, <a href="#sect115">turn to 115</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to press on, <a href="#sect83">turn to 83</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect11">11</a></h3>

<p>You quickly dodge into the doorway of a stable and hide your 
surgeon’s cloak in the straw, for it would be better to be seen as a Kai
 Lord than as a charlatan.</p>
<p>Without wasting a second, you set off towards the Great Hall on the other side of the courtyard.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect139">Turn to 139</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect12">12</a></h3>

<p>The bodyguard looks at you with great suspicion and then slams the 
door shut. You can hear the sound of voices inside the caravan. Suddenly
 the door swings open and the face of a wealthy merchant appears.</p>
<p>He demands 10 Gold Crowns as payment for the ride.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have 10 Gold Crowns and wish to pay him, <a href="#sect262">turn to 262</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you do not have enough Gold Crowns or do not wish to pay him, <a href="#sect247">turn to 247</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect13">13</a></h3>

<p>The path soon ends at a large clearing. In the centre of the clearing
 is a tree much taller and wider than any others you have seen in the 
forest.</p>
<p>Looking up through the massive branches you can see a large treehouse
 some twenty-five to thirty feet above the ground. There is no ladder, 
but the gnarled bark of the tree offers many footholds.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to climb the tree and search the treehouse, <a href="#sect307">turn to 307</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather press on, <a href="#sect213">turn to 213</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect14">14</a></h3>

<p>You reach the top of a small wooded hill on which several large 
boulders form a rough circle. Suddenly you hear a loud growl from behind
 a rock to your left.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to draw your weapon and prepare to fight, <a href="#sect43">turn to 43</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you would rather take evasive action by running as fast as you can over the hill, <a href="#sect106">turn to 106</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect15">15</a></h3>

<p>You pass through a long, dark tunnel of overhanging branches that 
eventually opens out into a large clearing. On a stone plinth in the 
centre of the clearing is a Sword, sheathed in a black leather scabbard.
 A handwritten note has been tied to the hilt, but it is in a language 
which is foreign to you.</p>
<p>You may take the Sword if you wish, and note it on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>There are three exits from the clearing.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to go east, <a href="#sect207">turn to 207</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to go west, <a href="#sect201">turn to 201</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to go south, <a href="#sect35">turn to 35</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect16">16</a></h3>

<p>You manage to free a horse from the straps securing it to the 
caravan. It is frightened by the scent of the approaching Doomwolves, 
and the cries of their evil riders—the Giaks.</p>
<p>Preparing your weapon, you spur your skittish horse towards the 
oncoming beasts. They are less than fifty yards away and they are 
lowering their lances at you as they get nearer and nearer.</p>
<p class="choice">You are charging head-on towards each other. <a href="#sect192">Turn to 192</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect17">17</a></h3>

<p>You raise your weapon to strike at the beast as its razor-fanged 
mouth snaps shut just inches from your head. Buffeted by the beating of 
its wings you find it difficult to stand.</p>
<p>Deduct 1 point from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> and fight the Kraan.</p>
<p class="combat">Kraan: <small>COMBAT&nbsp;SKILL</small>&nbsp;16 &nbsp;&nbsp;<small>ENDURANCE</small>&nbsp;24</p>
<p>If you kill the creature, you quickly descend the far side of the hill to avoid the Giaks.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you pick 0, <a href="#sect53">turn to 53</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you pick 1–2, <a href="#sect274">turn to 274</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you pick 3–9, <a href="#sect316">turn to 316</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect18">18</a></h3>

<p>You are awoken by the sound of troops in the distance. Across the 
lake you see the black-cloaked figures of Drakkarim and a pack of 
Doomwolves and their riders. A Kraan appears from above the trees and 
lands on the roof of the small wooden shack.</p>
<p>It is ridden by a creature dressed in red. The Kraan takes off and begins to fly across the lake to where you are hidden.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to use the Kai Discipline of Camouflage, <a href="#sect114">turn to 114</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to ride deeper in the forest, <a href="#sect239">turn to 239</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to fight the creature, <a href="#sect29">turn to 29</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect19">19</a></h3>

<p>Just ahead through the tall trees you can see clumps of dark-red 
gallowbrush, a thorny briar with sharp crimson barbs. The common name 
for this forest weed is ‘Sleeptooth’, for the thorns are very sharp and 
can make you feel weak and sleepy if they scratch your skin.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Tracking, <a href="#sect69">turn to 69</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">You can avoid the Sleeptooth by returning to the track. <a href="#sect272">Turn to 272</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">Or you can push on through the briars, deeper into the forest, by <a href="#sect119">turning to 119</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect20">20</a></h3>

<p>It seems that whoever lived here left in a great hurry—and they must 
have left quite recently. A half-eaten meal still remains on the table, 
and a mug of dark jala is still warm to the touch.</p>
<p>Searching a chest and small wardrobe, you find a Backpack, food (enough for two Meals), and a Dagger.</p>
<p>If you wish to take these items, remember to mark them on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. You continue your mission.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect273">Turn to 273</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect21">21</a></h3>

<p>You have ridden about two miles into the tangle of trees when the ground becomes very marshy.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If it is below 5, your horse has suddenly plunged into
 thick mud up to its belly. If the number is 5 or above, you manage to 
steer clear of the morass and may now <a href="#sect189">turn to 189</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are stuck, pick another number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.
 If this time the number is 7 or less, the mud engulfs you up to your 
armpits. Your horse gives one last despairing scream as its muzzle 
disappears into the bubbling mud. If you scored above 7, you drag 
yourself onto firm ground and <a href="#sect189">turn to 189</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If not, then this is your last chance! If you pick any
 number except a 9, the foul-smelling bog sucks you under and claims 
another victim. Your life and your mission end here. But if you have 
picked a 9, <a href="#sect312">turn to 312</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect22">22</a></h3>

<p>Knocking aside the leader, you sprint off along the highway. Then behind you the ominous <i>click</i> of a crossbow being cocked sends a shiver down your spine.</p>
<p>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have picked a number 0–4, <a href="#sect181">turn to 181</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect23">23</a></h3>

<p>The corridor soon widens into a large hall. At the far end, a stone 
staircase leads up to a huge door. Two black candles on either side of 
the stone steps dimly illuminate the chamber. You notice that no wax has
 melted, and as you get nearer you can feel that they give off no heat. 
Ancient engravings cover the stone surfaces of the walls.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration II]</div>
<p>Anxious to leave this evil tomb, you examine the door for a latch. An
 ornate pin appears to lock the door, but there is also a keyhole in the
 lockplate.</p>
<p class="choice">If you have a Golden Key and wish to use it, <a href="#sect326">turn to 326</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect24">24</a></h3>

<p>The merchant shouts to the driver of the caravan to jump. ‘We’re 
under attack!’ he cries, disappearing through a circular window.</p>
<p class="choice">If you decide to jump after him, <a href="#sect234">turn to 234</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect25">25</a></h3>

<p>You land with such a crash on the opposite roof, that the wind is 
knocked out of you and you lie flat on your back with your head in a 
spin.</p>
<p>It takes a minute or so for you to realize that you’ve made it and 
are perfectly safe. When you are sure you are all right, you jump up and
 let out a shout for joy at your skill and daring.</p>
<p>Quickly you find a way across the roof and climb down a long 
drainpipe to the street below. You see the large iron doors of the 
citadel open, and a wagon drawn by two large horses tries to leave. The 
horses are frightened by the noisy crowd and they both rear up, causing 
the wagon to smash a front wheel against the door. In the confusion, you
 see a chance to enter and quickly slip inside just as the guards slam 
the doors shut.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect139">Turn to 139</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect26">26</a></h3>

<p>Cautiously, you move along the corridor until you come to a sharp 
eastward turn. A strange greenish light can be seen in the distance.</p>

<p class="choice">If you wish to go back and try the southern route, <a href="#sect100">turn to 100</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect27">27</a></h3>

<p>You walk along this path for over an hour, carefully watching the sky
 above you in case the Kraan attack again. Up ahead, a large tree has 
fallen across the path. As you approach, you can hear voices coming from
 the other side of the massive trunk.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to attack, <a href="#sect250">turn to 250</a>.</p>
<p class="choice">If you choose to listen to what the voices say, <a href="#sect52">turn to 52</a>.</p>

<p class="choice">If you wish to head south, <a href="#sect147">turn to 147</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect29">29</a></h3>

<p>You stride out to the water’s edge and prepare yourself for combat. 
The Kraan and its rider spot you and begin to speed across the lake 
barely inches above the surface.</p>
<p>The rider lets out a scream that freezes your blood. He is a Vordak, a fierce lieutenant of the Darklords.</p>
<p>He is upon you and you must fight him. Deduct 2 points from your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small>
 unless you have the Kai Discipline of Mindshield, for the creature is

<h3><a name="sect30">30</a></h3>

<p>The people look tired and hungry. They have come many miles from 
their burning city. Suddenly, you hear the beat of huge wings coming 
from the north.</p>
<p>‘Kraan, Kraan! Hide yourselves!’ the cry goes up all along the road.</p>
<p>Just in front of you, a wagon carrying small children breaks down, 
its right wheel jammed in a furrow. The children scream in panic.</p>
<p class="choice">If you wish to help the children, <a href="#sect194">turn to 194</a>.</p>

cape, you turn and press deeper into the forest.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect264">Turn to 264</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect32">32</a></h3>

<p>You have ridden about three miles when, in the distance, you spot the
 unmistakable silhouette of five large Doomwolves. Riding on their backs
 are Giaks. They seem to be going on ahead to where the path leads down 
into an open meadow. Suddenly, one of the Giaks leaves the others and 
begins to ride back along the path towards you.</p>

<h3><a name="sect33">33</a></h3>

<p>The floor of the cave is quite dry and dusty. As you explore deeper 
in the half-light, you detect the stale odour of rotting flesh. 
Littering a crevice are the bones, fur, and teeth of several small 
animals. You notice a small cloth bag among these remains which you open
 to discover 3 Gold Crowns. Pocketing these coins, you leave what 
appears to be the lair of a mountain cat and carefully descend the hill.</p>

<h3><a name="sect34">34</a></h3>

<p>Without warning, a terrible apparition in red robes swoops down from

 a Vordak, a fierce lieutenant of the Darklords.</p>
<p>He is above you and you must fight him.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration III]</div>

<p>The forest is becoming denser, and the path more tangled with thorny

<p>After a few seconds, two small furry faces nervously appear over the

are everywhere. To the west lie the remains of their village but little 
is left of it now. They are trying to find the rest of their tribe who 
took to the forest when the ‘Black-wings’ attacked. They point behind 
them—east along the path—and tell you that the trail appears to be a 
dead end, but that if you continue through the undergrowth for a few 
yards more, you will find a watchtower where the path splits into three 
directions. Take the east path. This leads to the King’s highway between
 the capital city—Holmgard—and the northern port of Toran.</p>

 wind is knocked out of you and you lose consciousness.</p>
<p>You are awoken by the sharp pain of something stabbing your chest. It
 proves to be the tip of a Giak spear. You are greeted by the malicious 
sneer of its owner as he pins your left arm to the ground. Instinctively
 you reach for your weapon but it is no longer there.</p>
<p>Defenceless against the cruel Giaks, the last thing that you see

<p>It would seem that the heavens have not heard your prayers. A spear

horse. With a shriek of pain, the horse topples forward and you both 
roll in a tangled heap on the highway.</p>
<p>Dazed and pinned down by the weight of the dead body of your horse,

dust of the Graveyard covers you from head to toe.</p>
<p>Splashing through a shallow stream, you stagger towards the gate. The
 full horror of the Graveyard encounter begins to catch up with you. The

his men to a halt. He has recognized your cloak. They put away their

<p>Just as you feel the air beating on your back, you slip free of your 
horse and roll over—landing with a splash in a muddy ditch by the side 
of the highway.</p>
<p>You are uninjured, and you quickly scramble to your feet and make a 
dash for the cover of the trees—but with thirty yards left to run, you 
see the Kraan circling above for another dive.</p>

<h3><a name="sect85">85</a></h3>

<p>The path is wide and leads straight into thick undergrowth. The trees

suddenly you hear the beating of large wings directly above you. Looking
 up, you are shocked to see the sinister black outline of a Kraan diving
 to attack you.</p>

<p>Focusing your powers on the lock, you try to visualize the inner 
mechanism. Gradually its image appears in your mind’s eye. It is old and
 corroded but it still functions. You are in danger of losing your 
concentration when a subtle <i>click</i> confirms that your effort has not been in vain.</p>
<p>The pin is an easier task. Slowly it rises out of the lock and falls 
to the floor. The granite door swings towards you on hidden hinges and 
the grey half-light of the Graveyard floods into the tomb. The exit is 
overgrown with graveweed and you suffer many small cuts to your face and
 hands as you fight your way through to the surface. You are startled by
 a sudden noise. You turn to see the disembodied head of a corpse 
laughing at you.</p>
<p>In blind panic, you race through the eerie necropolis towards the southern gate.</p>

<p>You cautiously peer around the rock to see a soldier lying on his 
back. By his side is a Spear and shield. On the shield is the painting 
of a white pegasus—the Prince of Sommerlund’s emblem. He is one of the 
Prince’s soldiers, and he is only just conscious. His uniform is badly 
torn, and you can see that he has a deep wound in his left arm. As you 
move nearer, his eyes flicker open. ‘Heal me, my Lord,’ he begs. ‘I can 
barely feel my arm.’</p>

<p>The small shop is dark and musty. Books and bottles of every size and
 colour fill the many shelves. As you close the door, a small black dog 
begins to yap at you. A bald man appears from behind a large screen and

<h3><a name="sect92">92</a></h3>

<p>You dive for cover not a moment too soon, for a hail of black arrows 
scream out of the woods and bombard the area where you were standing 
seconds before. Pulling your cloak around you to blend into the dense 
bracken, you dash through the forest and away from the hidden ambushers 
as fast as possible. This entire area is infested by Giaks and you must 
escape as quickly as you can. You run without rest for over an hour 
until you happen to fall upon a straight forest path heading towards the
 east. You follow the path, taking care to keep watch for signs of the 
enemy.</p>

<h3><a name="sect93">93</a></h3>

<p>You turn and run for the stairs just as a large block falls with a 
crash behind you. The room you were in has been completely sealed off. 
As you escape into the daylight, you glimpse behind you the crooked 
figure of an old druid as he raises his staff. A second later, a bolt of
 lightning explodes at your feet. You do not stop but run headlong down 
the hill, cursing the delay but thankful for your Sixth Sense.</p>

<p>The Sage, seeing that you have killed his son, turns and runs from the shop by a back door.</p>
<p>You find 12 Gold Crowns in the robber’s purse and another 4 Gold 
Crowns in a wooden box under the counter. Carefully examining the 
potions and the wand you soon realize that they are all cheap 
counterfeits. In fact the entire shop is full of imitations. You shake

<h3><a name="sect96">96</a></h3>

<p>Holding your breath, you tighten your grip on your weapon and prepare
 to strike. The tension is unbearable—the Giaks are so close that the 
foul stench of their unwashed bodies fills your nostrils. You hear them 
curse in their strange alien tongue and then leave the ledge and start 
to scramble towards the peak. When you are sure they have gone, you 
finally exhale and wipe the sweat from your eyes.</p>

<p>Ahead of you, you can see a fierce battle raging across a stone 
bridge. The clash of steel and the cries of men and beasts echo through 
the forest. In the midst of the fighting, you see Prince Pelathar, the 
King’s son. He is in combat with a large grey Gourgaz who is wielding a 
black axe above his scaly head. Suddenly, the Prince falls wounded—a 
black arrow in his side.</p>

<p>The cold corridor suddenly makes an abrupt turning towards the east. 
You notice a greenish glow that lights the tunnel in the far distance. 
As you creep nearer you can see that the corridor opens out into a 
larger chamber.</p>
<p>The strange light seems to emanate from a large bowl resting upon the
 top of a granite throne. On a plinth in front of the throne stands a

<p>The noise of battle soon fades behind you but the ensuing silence is 
broken by a voice in your head that accuses you of being a coward, and 
deserting a fellow human in danger. You try to rid yourself of your 
nagging conscience by telling yourself that your mission is far more 
important, and that not only is the life of the young magician in peril 
but the lives of all your countrymen depend on you reaching the capital 
alive.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sight of a Giak war party in the distance makes you 
quickly take cover and hide. But it is too late—they have spotted you

 roof to your right. You hear their startled cries as you land with a 
crash on the other side. But it is the last sound that you will ever 
hear. The tiles splinter and collapse and you fall through the four 
floors of the ‘Green Slipper Inn’ breaking your back in several places.</p>

<p>You have covered about a quarter of a mile when you hear shouting and
 a noise like thunderclaps ahead. Edging nearer, you soon make out a 
clearing that you recognize to be the site of the ruins of Raumas, an 
ancient forest temple.</p>
<p>A war party of Giaks, some twenty-five to thirty strong, are 
attacking the ruins from all sides. Many more of the Giaks are dead or 
dying among the broken pillars of marble, but still they assault 
whatever is hidden inside. Suddenly, a bolt of blue lightning rips 
through the front rank of Giaks sending the armour-clad creatures 
tumbling in all directions. A Giak, taller than the others and dressed 
from head to foot in black chainmail, curses at his troops as he whips 
them forward with a barbed flail.</p>
<p>With weapon ready, you move to the edge of the clearing, under cover 
of the thick foliage, and try to catch a glimpse of the defenders. To 
your amazement, the ruins are being defended by a young man no older 
than yourself. You recognize his sky-blue robes, embroidered with stars.
 He is a young theurgist of the Magicians’ Guild of Toran: an apprentice
 in magic.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration IX]</div>
<p>Five Giaks charge forward, their spears raised to stab the apprentice
 as he hurriedly retreats deeper into the ruins. You see him turn and 
raise his left hand just before a bolt of blue flame shoots from his 
fingertips into the snarling Giak soldiers. Close to where you are 
hidden, you see a Giak scuttle past and climb one of the pillars of the 
temple. He has a long curved dagger in his mouth and he is about to jump
 on the young wizard standing below.</p>

You can hear voices chattering inside the caravan. Suddenly the door 
swings open and the face of a wealthy merchant appears. He recognizes 
your Kai cloak and apologizes for his servant’s behaviour.</p>
<p>He says that they have been attacked several times since they left 
Toran: by Kraan, by bandits, and by robbers. They thought you may have 
been a bandit. Inside, the caravan is full of silks and spices. The

detect the foul smell of decay ahead, similar to rotting meat. If you 
have a Torch and Tinderbox in your Pack, you may light the Torch to see 
your way ahead.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something heavy drops from the tunnel ceiling onto your 
back and you fall to your knees. It is a Burrowcrawler and you must 
fight it, for it is trying to strangle you with its long slimy 
tentacles.</p>

<p>You are at the very edge of the wood when your horse rears up in 
agony. The Kraan has sunk its claws deep into the horse’s hind legs and 
is trying to knock you to the ground with its wings. The ghoulish Giak

to the ground and dash for the trees, leaving the poor dying horse in 
the clutches of the Kraan.</p>

<p>Night falls and you are soon engulfed in darkness. To press on any

Tethering your horse to a tree, you pull your green Kai cloak about you 
and fall into a restless sleep.</p>
<p>You are awoken by the sound of troops in the distance. Across the 
lake you see the black shapes of Drakkarim and a pack of Doomwolves. A 
Kraan appears from above the trees and lands on the roof of the small 
wooden shack. It is being ridden by a creature dressed in red robes. The
 Kraan takes off and begins to fly across the lake to where you are

<p>After nearly an hour of drifting downstream, the water current 
becomes quite strong and you can see that you are being drawn towards a 
whirlpool near the centre as the river curves round. You know that if 
you are caught in the swirling water, you stand very little chance of 
escaping a watery death. You dive into the muddy river and as you begin

Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build 
for them the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic 
wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The construction of 
the city was a long and torturous nightmare, and only the strongest of 
the Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmospheres of Helgedad. This

beast. The sharp smell of its fetid black blood makes your stomach 
churn, but you are determined to press on. Then you notice a large 
saddlebag strapped to its chest. Opening the bag, you find a Message 
written on an animal skin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Orgadak shada taag okak—orgadak ok—nara ek ash jek eg Helgedad.’</i></p>

<p>Deeper in the bag is a Dagger. You may keep both the Message and the Dagger if you wish.</p>

<p>The madman lies dead at your feet. Two soldiers soon appear at the

<p>Keeping a watchful eye on the sky above, you move quickly along the 
track. You recall that this route leads to Fogwood, a small cluster of 
huts that have been used by a family of charcoal burners for nearly 
fifty years. After twenty minutes you reach the edge of a clearing where
 the huts are grouped in a small circle. There is no sign of the usual 
mist of wood smoke which gives Fogwood its apt name, and the huts are 
unusually quiet.</p>

<p>You have followed this twisting track for about twenty minutes when 
you hear the beating of wings high above the trees. Looking up you see a
 large Kraan approaching from the north, its huge black wings casting a 
gigantic shadow on the trees below.</p>
<p>On its back are two creatures armed with long spears. They are 
Mountain Giaks—small ugly creatures full of hatred and malice. Many 
centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the Darklords to build the 
infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the volcanic wastelands beyond 
the Durncrag mountain range. The construction of the city was long and 
torturous, and only the strongest of the creatures survived the heat and
 poisonous atmosphere of Helgedad.</p>

offers no cover from the sky. If you are attacked during this difficult 
climb, you will find it nearly impossible to fight back and remain

<p>Looking above the heads of the crowd, you notice that one of the 
shops opposite the main gate is the timbered surgery of a city 
physician. Suddenly, a bold plan springs to mind. Bracing yourself 
against the tide of bodies, you struggle across to the other side of the
 street. You quickly enter to find that there is no sign of life, apart 
from a brightly coloured parrot in its cage by the window.</p>
<p>Taking a selection of small bottles you slip on a white surgeon’s 
cloak, and fight your way back to the main gate. ‘An emergency!’ you 
bluff, as guards stop and question you. ‘It’s the royal cook’s 
wife…she’s having a baby.’</p>
<p>The guards hesitate for a moment, but you assure them that the matter
 is most urgent and they decide to let you in. One of the great doors 
swings open about two feet, and you are roughly pushed through the 
narrow gap into the courtyard beyond.</p>

<p>Your passage through the Graveyard will not be easy, for the ground

your cloak and cuts your legs. The air hangs heavy and still. Foul gases
 seep from open crypts and the haunting murmur of distant whispering 
fills your ears.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XVI]</div>

battle-weary, calls to an officer who turns and recognizes your cloak.</p>
<p>‘My Lord,’ he says. ‘Where are the other Kai Masters? We are in 
desperate need of their wisdom. The Darklords press us most cruelly and 
casualties are high.’</p>
<p>You inform the brave officer of the terrible fate of your kinsmen,

anyone who comes too close to the gates. An angry woman attacks one of 
them, pounding his chest with her clenched fists making him fall against
 the other guard. All three collapse in a struggling heap of flailing 
arms and legs. Seeing your chance, you dash forward and pull the large

his home in the last three hours. They were heading east.</p>

<p>In your haste to avoid the enemy, you catch your foot in a tree root 
and you are pitched head over heels in a tumble of dust and leaves. 
Crashing through the undergrowth at the base of the hill, you quickly 
pick up your weapon and run into the thick forest. The Kraan is no 
longer circling above, but you can make out the silhouette of two Giaks 
on the peak of the hill behind.</p>
<p>Wiping the grime from your eyes, you wince as you discover a large 
bruise on your forehead. Without delay, you run deeper into the safety 
of the forest.</p>

<h3><a name="sect317">317</a></h3>

<p>Instinctively you dive away from the stairs, and land on the stone 
floor. Your quick reactions have saved your life, for a vast granite 
block has fallen from the ceiling and crushed the steps, just in front 
of the lockplate!</p>
<p>Shaken but still in one piece, you get to your feet. A shaft of dull 
grey light is seeping into the chamber from above, where the stone block
 was. Through a hole in the ceiling you can see a tangle of graveweed 
and the cloudy sky above. You clamber out of the tomb and head for the 
arched south gate of the necropolis as fast as possible. The pointed log
 walls of the city’s outer defence works are now visible.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect61">Turn to 61</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect318">318</a></h3>

<p>Two soldiers and a sergeant run towards you, their crossbows aimed at
 your head. As they get nearer, they recognize your Kai cloak and a look
 of relief spreads across their faces.</p>
<p>‘My Lord,’ says the sergeant, ‘where are the other Kai Masters? We 
are in desperate need of their wisdom. The Darklords press us most 
cruelly and our casualties are high.’</p>
<p>You inform the brave soldier of the fate of your kinsmen, and the 
urgency of your mission to see the King. He takes you back to the barges
 where an officer accompanies you on horseback towards the high walls 
and the main gate of Holmgard.</p>

<h3><a name="sect319">319</a></h3>

<p>The slimy creature lets out a long, ghastly death-cry and collapses. 
You are near to panic and scramble to your feet, grabbing what you think
 to be your belt from the jaws of the dead beast. You can see light in 
the far distance, and you sprint for it as fast as you can. When you 
finally emerge into the daylight, you fall onto the leafy ground and 
fight for breath in painful gasps.</p>
<p>Slowly sitting upright, you notice that you are still wearing your 
belt—you had not lost it after all. What you grabbed from the jaw of the
 Burrowcrawler was a leather strap with a small pouch and a sheathed 
Dagger halfway along it. You break open the clasp to find it contains 20
 Gold Crowns. You may take both the Dagger and the Crowns if you are 
able to.</p>
<p>Feeling a little better now, you gather your Equipment together and push on eastwards into the forest.</p>

<h3><a name="sect320">320</a></h3>

<p>As you race across the open field towards the wood, a Kraan dives at 
you and claws your arm. Before you can fight back, it has flown off 
again, shrieking with cold malice.</p>

<h3><a name="sect322">322</a></h3>

<p>After what seems an eternity of struggling, you reach the peak of the
 steep hill. Behind you, above the canopy of trees, you can see the 
still smouldering remains of the monastery. To the north, a column of 
jet-black smoke rises high into the sky. Small orange tongues of flame 
flicker at its base. Your heart sinks as you realize that the port of 
Toran is ablaze.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a piercing cry above warns you that a Kraan is about to attack. It is about thirty yards away and diving for the kill.</p>
<p class="choice">If you are going to stand and fight it as it swoops down, <a href="#sect17">turn to 17</a>.</p>

<p>From the top of the tower you can see above the trees in all 
directions. Far to the north, a column of jet-black smoke rises high 
into the sky. Small orange tongues of flame flicker at its base. Your 
heart sinks as you realize that the port of Toran is ablaze. From the 
southwest, the wind carries the noise of battle. It is close; no more 
than five miles at most.</p>
<p>On the floor of the watchtower is a large oblong box.</p>

<p>You pull up your hood and drop down behind the rocks that litter the 
mouth of the cave. Holding your breath, you curl up into a tight ball, 
and completely cover yourself with your green cloak. Only a few minutes 
later the Giaks clamber over the rocky ledge outside, their evil yellow 
eyes furtively searching every crevice of the hillside.</p>
<p>Then cursing in their strange tongue, they leave the ledge and start 
to climb towards the peak. You silently thank your old Masters for 
teaching you the Kai Discipline of Camouflage—it has probably saved your
 life on this occasion.</p>

<p>Upon seeing you emerge from the woods, the Giak officer shouts <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘Ogot! Ogot!’</i> to his cowering troops, who flee the ruins and run to the safety of the forest.</p>
<p>Shaking his mailed fist at you, the black-clad Giak screams, <i xml:lang="x-giak">‘RANEG ROGAG OK—ORGADAKA OKAK ROGAG GAJ!’</i> before leaving. Surveying the scene of battle, you count over fifteen Giak dead lying among the broken pillars of Raumas.</p>
<p>The young wizard wipes his brow and walks towards you, his hand extended in friendship.</p>

<h3><a name="sect326">326</a></h3>

<p>You carefully insert the Key and turn it clockwise. You hear a dull <i>click</i>—the
 Key works. You lift out the pin, and the large granite door slowly 
swings towards you on hidden hinges. The grey half-light of the 
Graveyard floods into the tomb. The exit is overgrown with graveweed and
 you suffer many cuts to your face and arms as you fight your way 
through to the surface.</p>
<p>Looking back, you see the tomb door slowly close and a cruel inhuman 
laugh seems to rise out of the very ground on which you stand. In blind 
panic, you race through the eerie necropolis towards the south gate.</p>
<p class="choice"><a href="#sect61">Turn to 61</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="sect327">327</a></h3>

<p>Within a few minutes, you can see the Kraan hovering over a hilltop 
behind you. At a quick count you can make out at least sixteen of these 
horrible creatures, each of which has at least two Giaks riding upon its
 back. They are armed with long spears and wear tall pointed helmets of 
dull bronze. You hear the excited grunts of the Giaks. They have spotted
 you.</p>
<p>You jump for the entrance of the tunnel some twenty-five feet below, 
but your boot gets caught in a thorny briar and you hang helplessly 
upside down—weaponless and vulnerable. Fortunately for you the end is 
swift: As the first Giak lance pierces your heart, death is 
instantaneous.</p>
<p class="choice">Your life and your mission end here.</p>

<h3><a name="sect328">328</a></h3>

<p>As the creature dies, its body slowly dissolves into a vile green 
liquid. You notice that the grass and plants beneath the smoking fluid 
are beginning to shrivel and die. But a large valuable looking Gem lies 
on the ground near to the decaying body.</p>

<p>As you descend the ridge towards the Graveyard of the Ancients, you 
are aware of a strange mist and cloud that swirls all around this grey 
and forbidding place, blocking the sun and keeping the Graveyard in 
perpetual gloom.</p>
<p>A creeping chill seems to penetrate your very bones. Your horse 
becomes startled and no matter how you urge him on, he refuses to go any
 nearer to this dreadful place. So you must leave your horse and press

<h3><a name="sect331">331</a></h3>

<p>Surrounded by thorny briars and closely packed roots, you see the 
entrance of a tunnel disappearing into the hillside beyond. It is 
approximately seven feet in height and just over ten feet wide. As you 
get closer, you can feel a slight breeze coming from the inky blackness.
 If the other end of this tunnel emerges on the far side of the hill, it
 could save you many hours of difficult climbing. But it could also 
harbour unknown danger.</p>

<h3><a name="sect332">332</a></h3>

<p>You walk for nearly ten minutes along a dark and winding corridor, 
and then start to climb a steep staircase to a small wooden door. The 
man presses a secret catch and the door opens. You enter a large, 
plushly decorated bedroom with a huge marble bath that takes up one 
corner of the room. The man suggests that you refresh yourself here 
whilst he seeks an audience with the King.</p>
<p>You quickly bathe and change into some white robes that have been 
left out on a large marble table. Shortly, the man returns and leads you
 through a long corridor lined with exquisite tapestries. You finally 
arrive at a large door guarded by two soldiers wearing silver armour.</p>
<p>You are about to meet the King.</p>

<h3><a name="sect333">333</a></h3>

<p>You have cut your way through the thick undergrowth for nearly half 
an hour when you hear the beat of wings high above the trees. Looking up
 you can just make out the shape of a Kraan approaching from the north. 
It is one of the monsters that attacked the monastery and on its back 
are two grey-skinned creatures armed with long spears.</p>
<p>These are Mountain Giaks—evil servants of the Darklords, full of 
hatred and malice. Many centuries ago, their ancestors were used by the 
Darklords to build the infernal city of Helgedad, which lies in the 
volcanic wastelands beyond the Durncrag range of mountains. The 
construction of the city was long and torturous and only the strongest 
of the Giaks survived the heat and poisonous atmosphere of Helgedad.</p>
<p>Hidden by the trees, you freeze, keeping absolutely still as the 
Kraan passes overhead and disappears towards the south. When you are 
sure that it has gone, you move off once again into the forest.</p>

<p>You rush into the clearing and take the Giaks completely by surprise.

unsheathe their curved swords and attack you. You must fight them one at

your head aches violently. You cannot tell how long you have been

<p>Shocked, and then dejected by such a rebuff, you are carried along by

the stranger is not human. It is a Vordak, a hideous lieutenant of the 
Darklords and one of the undead. A piercing scream fills your ears, and 
the creature raises a huge black mace above its head and charges at you.
 Frozen with horror, you can also feel the Vordak attacking you with the

have been abandoned and there is little of apparent value left behind. 
Opening a small chest near the main door, you discover bunches of twigs 
that have been tied together with strong twine. One end of each bundle

<p>He is a young blond-haired youth with deep brooding eyes. His face is
 lined with exhaustion and the grime of battle, and his long sky-blue 
robes bear evidence of living rough in the wilds. He shakes your hand 
and bows. ‘My eternal thanks, Kai Lord. My powers are nearly drained. 
Had you not come to my aid, I fear I would have ended my days atop a 
Giak lance.’</p>
<p>He is weak and unsteady on his feet. You take his arm and sit him 
down upon a fallen pillar where you listen intently to what he has to 
say.</p>
<p>‘My name is Banedon. I am journeyman to the Brotherhood of the 
Crystal Star, which is the Magicians’ Guild of Toran. My Guildmaster has
 sent me to your monastery with this urgent message.’ He removes a 
vellum envelope from inside his robes and hands it to you.</p>
<p>‘As you see, I have opened the letter and read its contents. When the
 war started, I was on the highway with two travelling companions. The 
Kraan attacked us and we lost each other in the forest during our 
escape.’</p>
<p>The letter is a warning to the Kai Lords that the Darklords have 
mustered a vast army beyond the Durncrag Range. The Guildmaster urges 
the Kai to cancel the celebrations of Fehmarn and prepare for war.</p>
<p>‘I fear we were betrayed,’ says Banedon, his head bowed in sorrow.</p>
<p>‘One of my order, a brother called Vonotar, had explored the 
forbidden mysteries of the Black Art. Ten days ago he denounced the 
Brotherhood and killed one of our Elders. He has since disappeared. It 
is rumoured that he now aids the Darklords.’</p>
<p>You tell Banedon what has happened at the monastery, and of your 
mission to warn the King. Silently, he removes a gold chain from around 
his neck and hands it to you. On the chain is a small Crystal Star 
Pendant. ‘It is the symbol of my Brotherhood, and we are both truly 
brothers in this hour of darkness. It is a talisman of good fortune—may 
it protect you on your road ahead.’</p>
<p>You thank him, place the chain around your neck, and slip the Crystal Star<sup><a href="#sect349-1-foot" name="sect349-1">4</a></sup> inside your shirt. (Remember to mark this on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)</p>
<p>Banedon bids you farewell. ‘We must leave this place lest the Giaks 
return with more of their loathsome kind to put an end to us. I must 
return to my Guild. I bid you farewell, my brother. May the luck of the 
gods go with you.’</p>

<p>You enter the Chamber of State, a magnificent hall decorated lavishly
 in white and gold. The King and his closest advisers are studying a 
large map spread upon a marble plinth in the centre of the chamber. 
Their faces are lined with worry and concentration. A silence fills the 
hall as you tell of the death of your kinsmen and of your perilous 
journey to the citadel. As you finish your story, the King approaches 
and takes your right hand in his.</p>
<div class="illustration">[Illustration XX]</div>
<p>‘Lone Wolf, you have selfless courage: the quality of a true Kai 
Lord. Your journey here has been one of great peril and although your 
news comes as a grievous blow, the spirit of your determination is like a
 beacon of hope to us all in this dark hour. You have brought great 
honour to the memory of your Masters, and for that we praise you.’</p>
<p>You receive the praise and heartfelt thanks of the entire hall—an 
honour that brings a certain redness to your young face. The King raises
 his hand and all the voices cease.</p>
<p>‘You have done all that Sommerlund could have asked of a loyal son, 
but she is greatly in need of you still. The Darklords are powerful once
 more and their ambition knows no bounds. Our only hope lies within 
Durenor with the power that once defeated the Darklords an age ago. Lone
 Wolf, you are the last of the Kai—you have the skills. Will you journey
 to Durenor and return with the Sommerswerd, the sword of the sun? Only 
with that gift of the gods may we crush this evil and save our land.’</p>

<li>Add your <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> to any extra points given to you by your Kai Disciplines.</li>
<li>Subtract the <small>COMBAT SKILL</small> of your enemy from this total. This number = Combat Ratio.</li>
<li>Pick a number from the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>.</li>
<li>Turn to the <a href="#crtable">Combat Results Table</a>.</li>
<li>Find your Combat Ratio on the top of the chart and cross-reference to the random number you have picked. (E indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Enemy. LW indicates loss of <small>ENDURANCE</small> points to Lone Wolf.)</li>
<li>Continue the combat from Stage 3 until one character is dead. This is when the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points of either character fall to 0 or below.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="smevazn">To Evade Combat</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>You may only do this when the text of the adventure offers you the opportunity.</li>
<li>You undertake one round of combat in the usual way. All points lost by the enemy are ignored; only Lone Wolf loses the <small>ENDURANCE</small> points.</li>
<li>If the book offers the chance of taking evasive action in place of 
combat, it can be taken in the first round of combat or any subsequent 
round.</li>

<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>


<h3><a name="errintro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>We have taken our unique opportunity to correct errors and to enforce
 a standard of English usage. We list our changes here. If you see 
anything that needs correction, please <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Contact">contact</a> the Project Aon Staff.</p>
<h3><a name="errerr">Errata List</a></h3>

<p>(<a href="#title">Blurb</a>) Replaced ‘<cite>FLIGHT FROM THE DARK</cite>’ with ‘<strong><cite>Flight from the Dark</cite></strong>,’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#gamerulz">The Game Rules</a>) Replaced all occurrences of 
‘ie’ with ‘i.e.’ Removed ‘that you will find in the front of this book. 
For further adventuring you can copy out the chart yourself or get it 
photocopied’. Replaced ‘on 4’ with ‘on the number 4’. Removed ‘ on the 
last page of this book’. Replaced ‘fall to zero’ with ‘fall to zero or 
below’. Replaced ‘on to’ with ‘onto’. Replaced each occurrence of 
‘Chart. (ie’ with ‘Chart (i.e.’. Replaced ‘14.)’ with ‘14).’. Replaced 
‘points.)’ with ‘points).’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#discplnz">Kai Disciplines</a>) Replaced ‘Kai Discipline 
section’ with ‘Kai Disciplines section’. Removed ‘ on the last page of 
the book’. Capitalized all occurrences of ‘discipline’. Replaced ‘fully 
in <a href="#equipmnt">Equipment section</a>’ with ‘fully in the <a href="#equipmnt">Equipment section</a>’. Replaced ‘Lone Wolf’ with ‘<cite>Lone Wolf</cite>’
 when referring to the series. Replaced ‘Kai monastery’ with ‘Kai 
Monastery’. Replaced ‘will be of use’ with ‘may be of use’. Replaced 
‘Explained fully’ with ‘This will be explained fully’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment</a>) Added periods to the sentences describing the Helmet and Chainmail Waistcoat.</p>
<p>(<a href="#equipmnt">Equipment: How to use your equipment</a>) Added a
 period to the second from last sentence in the Weapons subsection. 
Replaced ‘food or’ with ‘food, or’. Replaced ‘two weapons’ with ‘two 
Weapons’. Added ‘You may only use one Weapon at a time in combat.’ in 
harmony with the recent Mongoose Publishing edition.</p>
<p>(<a href="#cmbtrulz">Rules for Combat</a>) Removed a superfluous 
period in the second paragraph of the first example. Removed ‘ on the 
inside back cover of the book’. Replaced ‘on the page after the <a href="#random">Random Number Table</a>’
 with ‘in the back of this book’. Replaced ‘reduced to zero’ with 
‘reduced to zero or below’. Replaced ‘points reduced’ with ‘points 
possibly reduced’. Replaced ‘at which point the one with the zero score 
is declared dead.’ with ‘at which point that combatant is declared 
dead.’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#levels">Levels of Kai Training</a>) The Levels of Kai Training section did not originally appear in this book, but has been added for the reader’s information.</p>
<p>(<a href="#kaiwisdm">Kai Wisdom</a>) Removed ‘on the back cover of the book ’. Replaced ‘Lone Wolf’ with ‘<cite>Lone Wolf</cite>’ when referring to the series.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect1">1</a>) Replaced ‘Sommerlund’ with ‘Sommlending’. Made the last choice (about using Sixth Sense) the first.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect4">4</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Tracking Discipline) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect7">7</a>) Added a period to the end of the 
illustration’s caption. Replaced ‘skipped and’ with ‘skipped, and’. 
Replaced ‘If the number if’ with ‘If the number is’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect17">17</a>) Changed the last choice that led to <a href="#sect331">Section 331</a> to lead to <a href="#sect316">Section 316</a> instead in order to parallel <a href="#sect89">Section 89</a>. It doesn’t make sense to skip the section describing the tumble downhill.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect18">18</a>) Moved the choice about the Camouflage Discipline into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect19">19</a>) Moved the choice about the Tracking 
Discipline into the first position. Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with 
‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect20">20</a>) Replaced ‘Jala’ with ‘jala’. Replaced ‘dagger’ with ‘Dagger’. The original versions of this book had this section lead to <a href="#sect272">Section 272</a>, which is incorrect. We are using the correct section, <a href="#sect273">273</a>, as used in more recent editions.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect21">21</a>) The text is unchanged but we have 
concatenated some of the paragraphs for the dice rolls for 
clarification. Replaced ‘on to’ with ‘onto’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect22">22</a>) Added a comma after ‘0–4’ in the first choice. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect23">23</a>) Reordered the choices. The choice that was
 originally first (about removing the pin) is now last. The choice about
 the Golden Key was originally last and is now first. Also added ‘and 
wish to use it’ after ‘Golden Key’. Added a period to the end of the 
illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect32">32</a>) Replaced ‘unmistakeable’ with ‘unmistakable’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect33">33</a>) Replaced ‘fur and’ with ‘fur, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect34">34</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect36">36</a>) Added a comma after ‘4 or lower’ in the first choice.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect37">37</a>) Added a blank line before the decisions and reversed their order.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect38">38</a>) Replaced both occurrences of ‘woodsmoke’ with ‘wood smoke’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect41">41</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect46">46</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect51">51</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect57">57</a>) Replaced ‘liquids and’ with ‘liquids, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect58">58</a>) Made the choice that led to <a href="#sect286">Section 286</a> to lead to <a href="#sect251">Section 251</a>
 instead. Many readers have realized that there was an error here but 
assumed that the original numbers for the choices should simply be 
reversed, giving Lone Wolf a chance at survival for hiding and certain 
death for riding on. Actually, there is no certain death possibility 
here. Hiding is supposed to grant you certain survival. The proof of 
this correction is that there is no other path to <a href="#sect251">Section 251</a>, and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect61">61</a>) Replaced ‘blood-smeared and’ with ‘blood-smeared, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect62">62</a>) Replaced ‘crossbow had’ with ‘crossbow has’. Replaced ‘west and’ with ‘west, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect63">63</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect67">67</a>) Made the choice that led to <a href="#sect140">Section 140</a> to lead to <a href="#sect252">Section 252</a> instead. If you read <a href="#sect222">Section 222</a>, you’ll notice that the choice leading to <a href="#sect252">Section 252</a> is the east track. Indeed, only <a href="#sect140">Section 140</a> may lead you to the bear of which Tracking is supposed to warn you in this section.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect69">69</a>) Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with ‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect70">70</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect71">71</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect73">73</a>) Replaced ‘the Darklords cruellest troops’ with ‘the Darklords’ cruellest troops’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect75">75</a>) Replaced ‘border rangers’ with ‘Border Rangers’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect76">76</a>) Replaced ‘slip it into the pocket of your 
jacket’ with ‘slip this Vordak Gem into your Backpack’. Replaced ‘horse 
and’ with ‘horse, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect82">82</a>) Replaced ‘steed and’ with ‘steed, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect83">83</a>) Added another ‘s’ after ‘posses’ in the last choice and moved that choice into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect87">87</a>) Replaced ‘Graveweed’ with ‘graveweed’. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect88">88</a>) Replaced ‘or do’ with ‘or if you do’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect91">91</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect97">97</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect105">105</a>) Replaced ‘jet black’ with ‘jet-black’. Replaced ‘skill,’ with ‘skill, or if you do not wish to use it,’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect112">112</a>) Replaced ‘cavemouth’ with ‘cave mouth’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect119">119</a>) Replaced ‘Gallowbrush’ with ‘gallowbrush’: you can’t pick it up.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect120">120</a>) Replaced ‘strike, then’ with ‘strike and then’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect121">121</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect122">122</a>) Split the first sentence which was actually two independent clauses into two sentences to fix it.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect125">125</a>) Moved the last choice (about the Tracking Discipline) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect128">128</a>) Replaced ‘border ranger’ with ‘Border Ranger’. Replaced ‘Durncrag mountains’ with ‘Durncrag Mountains’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect131">131</a>) Replaced ‘Magicians Guild of Toran’ with ‘Magicians’ Guild of Toran’. Replaced ‘area, and’ with ‘area and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect132">132</a>) Replaced ‘sumptuous Meal’ with ‘sumptuous meal’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect137">137</a>) Replaced ‘20 Gems’ with ‘20 Tomb Guardian Gems’ and ‘mark these on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>’ with ‘mark these on your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a> as a single Backpack Item’ based on changes made to the Mongoose Publishing edition.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect142">142</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag range’ with ‘Durncrag Range’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect144">144</a>) Added ‘ or if you have no Backpack 
Items’ to the second paragraph. Replaced ‘one Item is stolen’ with ‘one 
item is stolen’. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s 
caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect151">151</a>) Added ‘If you wish to remove the pin, 
turn to 337.’ This is the only other possible choice for what is a 
strangely one-sided option in the original text. More flavourful 
language might make more sense, such as ‘If you still wish to remove the
 pin with your hands,’ but to best preserve the integrity of the text, 
we simply copied the choice from <a href="#sect23">Section 23</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect152">152</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect153">153</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag range’ with ‘Durncrag Range’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect154">154</a>) Replaced ‘head first’ with ‘head-first’.
 Replaced ‘last thing you feel are the black shafts’ with ‘last things 
you feel are the black shafts’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect163">163</a>) Replaced ‘nearly an half’ with ‘nearly half’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect166">166</a>) Replaced ‘tortuous’ with ‘torturous’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect167">167</a>) Moved the last choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect170">170</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect172">172</a>) Moved the second choice (about the Camouflage Discipline) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect175">175</a>) Moved the last choice (about the 
Camouflage Discipline) into the first position. Replaced ‘border 
rangers’ with ‘Border Rangers’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect181">181</a>) Removed ‘You have lost your Weapons and 
Equipment, but not your life.’ from the end of the second paragraph 
because it is possible to reach this section of the book without having 
lost your equipment.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect184">184</a>) Replaced ‘Sword and’ with ‘Sword, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect192">192</a>) Replaced ‘Kraan, and’ with ‘Kraan and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect197">197</a>) Deleted a superfluous space after the word ‘wish’ at the very end of the second sentence.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect196">196</a>) Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect200">200</a>) Reversed the order of the choices. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect201">201</a>) Changed the choice that led to <a href="#sect215">Section 215</a> to lead to <a href="#sect15">Section 15</a>
 instead. The original choice appears to make sense, but does not work 
out in a map. The indication that the correct section is really <a href="#sect15">15</a> is the fact that it is not otherwise accessible (though <a href="#sect215">Section 215</a> is) and <a href="#sect15">15</a> leads back to <a href="#sect201">Section 201</a> when taking the opposite direction.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect205">205</a>) Added ‘(You must now erase all Weapons and Backpack Items from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>.)’ based on the Mongoose Publishing edition. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect211">211</a>) Moved the second choice (about Sixth Sense) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect212">212</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect218">218</a>) Replaced ‘war cries’ with ‘war-cries’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect221">221</a>) Replaced ‘rough hewn’ with ‘rough-hewn’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect222">222</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect226">226</a>) Replaced ‘head first’ with ‘head-first’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect228">228</a>) Replaced ‘axe’ with ‘weapon’ because another weapon is available in <a href="#sect305">Section 305</a>. Replaced ‘dense, and’ with ‘dense and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect235">235</a>) Moved the last choice (about Tracking) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect236">236</a>) Added ‘(Remember to erase the Vordak Gem from your <a href="#action">Action Chart</a>. If you had two Gems, you need erase only one.)’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect246">246</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect252">252</a>) Replaced ‘men and’ with ‘men, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect254">254</a>) Replaced ‘Durncrag mountains’ with ‘Durncrag Mountains’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect260">260</a>) Replaced ‘spreadeagled’ with ‘spread-eagled’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect267">267</a>) Capitalized ‘message’ in the second 
sentence of the second paragraph, since that is how retrievable items 
are supposed to be represented, and to be consistent with the first time
 the item is mentioned in this section. Added a period to the end of the
 illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect268">268</a>) Replaced ‘wary’ with ‘weary’. We hardly think Lone Wolf would be wary among the King’s soldiers.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect272">272</a>) Replaced ‘wood-smoke’ with ‘wood smoke’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect275">275</a>) Replaced ‘tortuous’ with ‘torturous’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect276">276</a>) Replaced ‘your Axe’ with ‘your weapon’ because another weapon is available in <a href="#sect305">Section 305</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect277">277</a>) Replaced ‘<a href="#sect113">Turn 113</a>’ to ‘<a href="#sect113">Turn to 113</a>.’</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect284">284</a>) Replaced both occurrences of ‘Graveweed’
 with ‘graveweed’. Added a period to the end of the illustration’s 
caption and separated its clauses with a dash instead of a comma.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect291">291</a>) Replaced ‘Spears and’ with ‘Spears, and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect295">295</a>) Replaced ‘to try and’ with ‘to try to’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect297">297</a>) Replaced all occurrences of ‘your axe’ with ‘your weapon’ because another weapon is available in <a href="#sect305">Section 305</a>.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect304">304</a>) Replaced ‘slip it’ with ‘slip this Vordak Gem’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect307">307</a>) Added a period to the end of the illustration’s caption.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect311">311</a>) Moved the last choice (about Camouflage) into the first position.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect315">315</a>) Replaced ‘Items’ with ‘items’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect319">319</a>) Replaced ‘death cry’ with ‘death-cry’. Replaced ‘fnd’ with ‘find’. Replaced ‘half way’ with ‘halfway’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect322">322</a>) Replaced ‘jet black’ with ‘jet-black’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect323">323</a>) Replaced ‘jet black’ with ‘jet-black’. Replaced ‘ladder, and’ with ‘ladder and’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect326">326</a>) Replaced ‘Graveweed’ with ‘graveweed’. Replaced ‘click’ with ‘<i>click</i>’.</p>
<p>(<a href="#sect333">333</a>) Replaced ‘tortuous’ with ‘torturous’.</p>

legally responsible to ensure that that child behaves in accordance with
