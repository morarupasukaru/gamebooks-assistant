# Previous versions of the application

### Year 2017

Version partially finished that use [AngularJS material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/).

See [angularjs-angularmaterial git-branch](https://github.com/morarupasukaru/gamebooks-assistant/tree/abandoned-version/angularjs-angularmaterial)

I abandonned this version due to fact that angularjs and angular material are deprecated by google.


### Year 2016

Version developed with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and [Bootstrap v3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).
 
This version works well on desktop but not very well on mobile (too many click and user-interaction required).

See [angularjs-bootstrap3 git-branch](https://github.com/morarupasukaru/gamebooks-assistant/tree/abandoned-version/angularjs-bootstrap3)
