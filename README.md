# Gamebooks Assistant

[Gamebooks Assistant](http://morarupasukaru.github.io/gamebooks-assistant/) is webapplication to ease the  resolution of [gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook).

The motivation of this "private" project is to help me to learn how-to to develop a professional responsive-design single page application in plain javascript and with as few tools as possible.

The "Business" goal is to be able to play a gamebook with a book in a hand and a smartphone in the other hand.

## Project status

### Year 2018
* Hope to be able to provide a mobil offline spa plurilingual version
* Mobile version will replace the Desktop version

### Year 2017
* Try to use [AngularJS material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) but abandonned due to lack of support as angularjs and related projects has been deprecated by google.
* Focus on a minimal mobil version with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and [purecss](https://purecss.io/)

### Year 2016
* A first version is developed with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and [Bootstrap v3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
* This version works well on desktop but not very well on mobile (the use of the apps required to many user-interaction)
