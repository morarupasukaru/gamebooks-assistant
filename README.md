## Project status
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/
### Year 2016
* A first version is developed with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and [Bootstrap v3]()
* This version works well on desktop but not very well on mobile (the use of the apps required to many user-interaction)

### Year 2017
* Try to use [AngularJS material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) but abandonned due to lack of support as angularjs and related projects has been deprecated by google.
* Focus on a minimal mobil version with [material components web](https://material.io/components/) and without additional framework

### Year 2018
* Hope to be able to provide a mobil offline spa plurilingual version
* "Desktop" version will be refactored to integrate some part of the mobil version
