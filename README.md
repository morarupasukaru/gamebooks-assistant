# Gamebooks Assistant

[Gamebooks Assistant](http://morarupasukaru.github.io/gamebooks-assistant/) is web-application to ease the  resolution of [gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook).

The motivation of this "private" project is to help me to learn how-to to develop a professional responsive-design single page application in plain javascript and with as few tools as possible.

The "Business" goal is to be able to play a gamebook with a book in a hand and a smartphone in the other hand.
