### Year 2018
* Hope to be able to provide a mobil offline spa plurilingual version
* Mobile version will replace the Desktop version

### Year 2017
* Try to use [AngularJS material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) but abandonned due to lack of support as angularjs and related projects has been deprecated by google.
* Focus on a minimal mobil version with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and [purecss](https://purecss.io/)

### Year 2016
  description : Version with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and [Bootstrap v3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
  git-branch  : todo
  notes       : this version works well on desktop but not very well on mobile (the use of the apps required to many user-interaction)
